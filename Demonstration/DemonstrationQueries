Start from the beginning:

Setting up our company, we need create the rooms in the building.
CALL CreateNewRoom('110', null, null, 'KS', '1');

Going to need some employees:
CALL HireNewEmployee('Joseph', '555-444-5544', '101 Joseph lane', 'Joseph@employee.com');

Making Joseph into a housekeeper:
CALL MakeEmployeeAHousekeeper((select empID from employee where name = 'Joseph'));

We have our first guest!
Call CreateGuest('Guest1', '12-12-1998', '101 Guest's house lane', 'Guest@email.com');

The guest wants to rent a room for tonight, they have to pay first though!
CALL CreatePayment((select guestID from guest where name = 'Guest1'), 'CA', '50', '2020-07-04');

Now that the guest has paid, we create a reservation for them!
CALL CreateReservation(select paymentID from guest INNER JOIN payment on guest.guestID = payment.guestID where name = 'Joe Jacobs' order by paymentID DESC LIMIT 1),
  (select guestID from guest where name = 'Guest1'), '2020-07-04', '2020-07-05', '1', '0', '75', null);
  
Now lets assign the guest a room!
CALL SetRoomInUse('110', (select guestID from guest where name = 'Guest1'),select reservationID from guest INNER JOIN reservation on guest.guestID = reservation.guestID 
  where guest.guestID = (select guestID from guest where name = 'Joe Jacobs') order by reservationID DESC LIMIT 1);
  
The next morning, the guest is ready to leave! Lets check them out.
CALL SetRoomAvailable('110');

Now we made some rooms, hired some new employees, registered a guest, got paid by the guest, created a reservation, assigned a room to the guest, 
  and checked the guest out of the hotel!
