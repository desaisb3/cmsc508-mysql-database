Project: HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The hotel management system is designed to solve the problem of keeping track of the various assets the hotel has, as well as staff and clients. The hope is that through using a computerized system in a database rather than paper bookkeeping, the hotel will be able to offer online services to clients, as well as have faster access to relevant data when talking with customers, or when reviewing the business.

The scope of this system would be to a single hotel, though it could theoretically be expanded to allow multiple hotels under the same company. We want to prove that this management system will work in a single hotel, before potentially expanding it to accomodate more.

We expect the system users to be able to:
  See and modify guests
    (Id's, Names, DOB, Addresses, Emails, Phone Numbers)
  See and modify the status of rooms
    (Room number, GuestID's, Reservation Id's, Room Types, Room floor)
  See and modify Payments
    (Payment ID's, Reservation ID's, Guest ID's, Payment Types, Amounts, Payment Dates, Discount)
  See and modify housekeeping informations
    (Employee ID's, Names, Phone numbers)
  See and modify shifts for housekeeping
    (Employee ID's, Start times, stop times, dates)
